[[overview]]
== Overview
This is a guide to show developers how to interact with this service (though it doesn't try very hard)

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

Restaurant Service tries (though again, not very hard) to be restful with its verbs (though its url's need to be better)

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

Restaurant Service tries to be sane with its HTTP status codes.

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist.
